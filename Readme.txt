Deferred rendering (Rembrandt) should be enabled to make use of the headlights. 
Note: Shadows do not look great, so I suggest you disable it under Rembrandt.

Normal mode (Rembrandt and ALS disabled) can be used if your computer does not support Rembrandt. I strongly suggest you never use ALS with this mod because reflection function of the car will be gone and the model does not look as nice.
